Changelog started 2018/11/9

Technically, this project was fully functional before the changelog was created. However, the Irrlicht interface is in flux, so some of this is simply testing.
However, a number of important bug fixes and changes have happened since the complete of my first application with this bridge (Tic Tac Toe).
- Fixed bugs in cubr_attr that incorrectly used s32 values instead of f32 values when saving to certain data types.
- Updated the CuBridge methods to work with the new Copper FFIServices interface.
