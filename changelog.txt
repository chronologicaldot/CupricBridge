====================
2021/1/14

- Fixed GUIWatcher::OnEvent() blocking event passback.
- Added GUIWatcher::bringToFront() to allow inserting GUIWatcher between element and its parent.
- Added IGUIElement parenting in gui_create().
- Completed AttributeSource::existsAttribute() code.
- Minor fixes to string return in AttributeSource::getAttributeAsStringW().


====================
2020/5

- Added cubr_image.h and cubr_image.cpp


====================
2019/12/31

- Fixed bug in CuBridge::gui_watcher() that failed to set the GUIWatcher element to the alignment of the element it wraps, but the fix requires my custom IGUIElement::getAlignment().


====================
2019/8/5

- Added ability to remove all children via CuBridge::gui_remove_children(), GUIElement::removeChildren()


====================
2018/12/5-6 - 2018/12/16-19

- Changed CuBridge methods for Copper to use and return ForeignFunc::Result values.
- Changed MultifileRunner::require() to print a warning message instead of error message when the path size is zero.
- Added GUIElement::expandToParentBounds() and CuBridge::gui_expand() to use it.
- Added GUIWatcher (guiwatcher.h and .cpp).
- Added cubr_irrevent_translate (.h and .cpp).
- Changed CuBridge::setGUIEnvironment() to have an argument for a new root GUI element too (since the old one cannot be used).
- Added CuBridge::gui_watcher() to create GUIWatcherObjects.
- Fixed CuBridge::gui_getRoot() to reference-count the root element. If this isn't done, then it segfaults when the program closes.
- Fixed GUI element constructors in CuBridge to use rootElement for parent instead of the root GUI element from IGUIEnvironment.


====================

Changelog started 2018/11/9

Technically, this project was fully functional before the changelog was created. However, the Irrlicht interface is in flux, so some of this is simply testing.
However, a number of important bug fixes and changes have happened since the complete of my first application with this bridge (Tic Tac Toe).
- Fixed bugs in cubr_attr that incorrectly used s32 values instead of f32 values when saving to certain data types.
- Updated the CuBridge methods to work with the new Copper FFIServices interface.
