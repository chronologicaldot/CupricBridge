Whenever I include in my premake file the following line in the build options:
		--, "-I" .. v_b_copper_exts_path .. "Math/" -- For some reason, I'm getting a segfault when this is enabled (see below)
I get this from gdb:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

UPDATE:
The problem occured within the Copper basicmath.cpp where the C++ standard library was used. I guess it conflicts with Irrlicht somehow.
